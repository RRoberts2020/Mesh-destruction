Launching program build:

To access the build for this project, navigate to the Build folder and click on "Mesh D.exe" to start up the program.

Once the program launches, you will see one of two examples on the screen for mesh destruction.


Pre-cell fracture will demonstrate the ability for pre-sliced meshes to be destroyed on screen

If you press "E" you will be able to see in real-time what happens when pre-sliced meshes are triggered,
to become the destroyed state.


Live cell fracture will demonstrate the ability for solid/whole meshes to be destroyed on-screen during real-time.

If you click and drag your mouse across the mesh you will be able to slice the object, however,
due to an unknown error, the mesh will not separate by itself when sliced, since it cannot react to gravity


Additional controls:

Numpad 1 to switch to viewing Pre-cell fracture.

Numpad 2 to switch to viewing Live cell fracture.
